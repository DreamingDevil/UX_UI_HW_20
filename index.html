      <h4>The Client | The Team | The Problem</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="left-align">
        <h3>The Client</h3>
        <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees agricultural production industries, rural development, and all
          points from farm to table related to consumer food health and security.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Team</h3>
        <p>Kenneth Li, Karen McRorie & Misba Saman, <br><i>UX/UI Bootcamp, University of Toronto Continuing
            Education</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3>My Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Collaborative: initial user research, information architecture and site map design <br>Independent:
          wireframing, prototyping, usability testing</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
        <p>5 Weeks</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p><b>When the USDA site had undergone a responsive web redesign in 2017, they created a fluid design. The
            mobile version looked great and functioned well.</b>
          <br></br>
          The desktop view, however, looked empty and static. The menus that were streamlined for mobile gave the user
          few clues about where they were in the site or how to find information. Fonts were small are there were few
          other affordances for accessibility.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Our solution was to keep the strengths of “mobile-first” thinking but with adaptive responsiveness that took
          advantage of the larger screen format of desktop. By shifting from an alphabetical to a categorical
          organization strategy for a new IA, we made menus more intuitive and decreased the number of clicks to key
          resources.</p>

      <h2>Discovery Phase - Understanding the User</h2>
      <h4>Proto-Persona | User Research | User Persona</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="left-align">
        <h3>Proto Persona: Why focus on Stoic Steve?</h3>
        <p>USDA is the fourth largest federal government website. With 29 agencies and regional offices, 4 operational priorities and at least 5 distinct user groups, we needed a place to begin.</p>
        <p>We took our cue from the emphasis placed farmers and ranchers on the USDA homepage content at the time (it has since changed). Also, from USDA’s vision statement, with its emphasis on agricultural production, national food security, and rural development.</p>
        <p>So we created the proto persona Stoic Steve, a farmer from Kentucky, to keep us user-centered.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>User Research: Overcoming project limitations</h3>
        <p>Our project required us to complete our user interviews within 5 days. The call out for users returned a sample of convenience rather than our target group. We went ahead with usability testing of the current site, knowing insights would be limited and incomplete.</p>
        <p>We needed to understand farmers and farming as a business. We took to secondary research to fill the gap. We read USDA’s blogs and newsletters. We conducted a  competitor analysis of marketing sites for farm management software systems. This gave us insight into the specific logistics and capabilities unique to farming, the financial and project management skills needed, and the planning risk-reward ratios that farmers were continually recalculating.</p>

      <h4>Heuristic Analysis | Heuristic Testing  | Insights</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="left-align">
        <h3>Heuristic Analysis: What Works and Doesn’t Work for Steve?</h3>
        <p>An heuristic analysis helped us to identify potential challenges in the existing homepage and site design. We honed in on navigation strategies.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Does the Primary Menu Work as Intended?</b></p>
        <p>Farm-related content was collapsed with other content under Topics. Could Steve scan the menu to find information quickly? We created two tasks for users that would force them to start their search under “Topics”</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Did the Shortcut Cards Make Key Tools and Resources Discoverable?</b></p>
        <p>The main content area of USDA’s homepage had short-cut cards that led to important resources for Steve. We devised three tasks that required Steve to navigate to a specific tool from these cards.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Testing For Scanning, Readability and Discoverability</b></p>
        <p>Of the total 40 tasks that needed to be completed by our 8 users, 12 were completed with at least partial success, scored by time and maximum allowed number of clicks.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Sorting Test Data: 3 Main Issues to Solve</b></p>
        <p>From the data collected from usability tests, we conducted an affinity diagram followed by a priority matrix to focus on 3 site structure issues we would work to solve.</p>
        <p>1. Primary menu does not give enough navigational aid, while secondary and tertiary menus are too long</p>
        <p>2. More hierarchy in information architecture may help users to understand site and where they are within it</p>
        <p>3. relationships between the main departmental site and the subsites of USDA agencies needs to made explicitly clear.</p>

      <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
      <h4>User Insight | Problem Statement | Hypotheses</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
        <div class="left-align">
          <h3>User Insight</h3>
          <p>Sophisticated Steve’s time is a precious resource. He allocates it carefully so that there’s enough time in the day for all the responsibilities related to his farm operation.</p>
          <p>Whether looking for market information to help him plan his growing season, or looking for low-interest relief after a disaster, Steve wants to find it quickly and feel confident that he hasn’t missed key information or steps. </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>Users like Steve don’t perceive the organizing structure of the USDA site. They spend extra time and get lost or pursue wrong paths. This is a problem because time wasted looking for information on the USDA site can lead to frustration and an erosion of trust of its core constituents.</p>
          <p>The way information is organized on the USDA site needs to make sense to Steve and navigation should be easy for him to intuit or learn. The IA should help him discover government policies, new research, and financial tools that are relevant to his farm’s success.</p>
          <p>How can we create a site and navigation strategy so that Steve can see the most relevant tools and resources within 2 clicks and navigate to specific ones within 3 clicks.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Refining  Usability Insights</h3>
          <p>Users were given three tasks that would allow us to measure the time and number of clicks required to navigate homepage content and short-cut cards and to measure their success using the existing primary, secondary and tertiary menus of the current site. Four testers completed the tasks on desktop and 4 testers completed the tasks on mobile.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
          <p>User performance on secondary and tertiary menus scored poorly. One reason why users found these menus difficult to use was that they were very long. The longest, “Topics” dropdown had 20 items.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Hypothesis #1: By reducing the number of items in a given menu, we will make navigation easier to scan and user success rates with secondary and tertiary menus will go up.</b></p>
          <p>Mobile users were almost twice as successful in scanning the 20-item “Topics” menu. A possible explanation is that the mobile menu fills the entire screen, minimizing distractions and reducing cognitive load.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Hypothesis #2: By clustering related content together and reducing outside visual distractions, users will find it easier to locate information within the secondary and tertiary menus.</b></p>

      <h2>Development Phase - New Information Architecture & Sitemap</h2>
      <h4>Sitemap | Wireframing | Lo-Fi Testing</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="left-align">
        <h3>Developing a new Information Architecture and Sitemap</h3>
        <p>Our goal was to create a site structure that would make sense to Sophisticated Steve, applying what we’d learned from primary and secondary research to several rounds of card sorting.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>IA solution: From Explaining to Serving</b></p>
        <p>The existing IA for the USDA main site was to emphasize the departmental structure. The primary menu consisted of these four items: Topics, Our Agency, Priorities, Media. The Media landing page consisted of USDA communication channels, but also included a link for news media.</p>
        <p>This menu approach prioritized explaining over serving user groups directly. The new IA design was developed on the concept of identifying and serving user groups through the primary menu.</p>
        <p>This meant collapsing the Topics and Priority menus. The Priority pages became the top item in secondary menus. The Priorities of Equity and Climate change crossed user categories, so were given their own space.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Agency Information and Media Contact Information</b></p>
        <p>Secondary research of other US department sites validated the decision to move Agency Information to the Footer. Media was moved to the Utilities menu.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Secondary Menus Make Resources Discoverable</h3>
        <p>In the existing USDA site, resources such as the “Loan Eligibility” tool were buried three levels. Links to other sites could be found at the bottom of the homepage, under “Featured,” which had been confusing to our testers. This meant that Sophisticated Steve could easily miss useful information or resources.</p>
        <p>To increase “discoverability” of resources and USDA agency subsites, links to these were included in the secondary menus based on their main target users. </p>

      <h2>Development Phase - Iteration, Testing & More Iterating</h2>
      <h4>Applying System Design | Mid-Fi Testing | Hi-Fi Iterating</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
        <div class="left-align">
          <h3>Taking a Conservative Approach to  Design System</h3>
          <p>I took a conservative approach to making changes to the existing design. Our initial heuristic analysis identified few issues with the design, especially when viewed on smaller screens, other than big swaths of unused space combined with smallish fonts when the design flowed on to larger screens. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Goal 1: Maintain the USDA brand identity that gives a unified look to all USDA sites. 
          </b></p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Goal 2: Add warmth and visual interest to the all-blue, corporate look</b></p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Goal 3: ensure font sizes and colour combinations achieve at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio
          </b></p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Mid-Fi Testing: Refining the Mobile Navigation</h3>
          <p>An early version of the mobile menu, I responded to user feedback by removing the “Agencies” category. However, users were confused by the underlined links. Rather than signifying external links, the underlined text in this context signified “active.”</p>
          <br>
          <p>One version of the mobile navigation strategy involved a series of overlays. The goal was to reduce cognitive load (number of choices) but still providing something like the mega menu advantages.</p>
          <br>
          <p>All of my usability testers complained about this strategy. The problem was, in part, it was unexpected. This surprise distracted from their goal of navigating and was disorienting. </p>

      <h4>Hi-Fi Prototypes</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="left-align">
        <h3>Final Iterations</h3>
        <p>Observations and notes from usability testing were processed using affinity diagrams and a feature priority matrix to identify actionable priorities for the prototype deliverables.</p>
        <p>The sitemap was tweaked to improve the content categories, based on user errors when completing task and debriefing with them afterward. The desktop menu was enlarged to use more of the hero space area and to accommodate user requests for large font and spacing between menu items. </p>
        <p>Cards were redesigned based on users likes and dislikes, including revisions to the UX copy to strength calls-to-action.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Reduce Amount of Homepage Content to Reduce Scrolling?</b></p>
        <p>Especially for the mobile, user feedback indicated that the homepage was too long and users tired of scrolling.</p>
        <p>Without access to a real client, I felt that I had to be cautious about removing any features or content. I did reduce the number of cards featuring blog articles from 6 to 2 and replaced those with hyperlinks.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>More UI</b></p>
        <p>To accommodate the same amount of content while reducing scrolling, I added horizontal scrolling of the blog section and featured sites.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Testing UI for Brand Character</b></p>
        <p>The card shuffle UI represents a next step for usability testing, possibly A/B testing. Designed to draw attention to the key area and invite users to focus on each card separately, I wonder whether the effect is too new and too gimmicky for the USDA brand.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts & Key Points</h2>
      <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
        <div class="left-align">
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <br>
        <p><b>#1 Ideate Across Platforms</b></p>
        <p>Out of this project, the biggest challenge became how to design for my information architecture strategy on mobile.</p>
        <p>The USDA 2017 redesign of the USDA clearly had a mobile-first approach when collapsing all 20 content under “Topics.” Doing so allowed them to keep a small primary menu that easily scaled down to mobile screens.</p>
        <p>By reintroducing categories related to each area of USDA mandate, I expanded the primary menu from 4 to 7 items. I found it very challenging to create a menu strategy that was both logical and easy for mobile users. My mistake, I believe, occurred during the IA conceptualization phase. I needed to be more cognizant of mobile users at that phase.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>#2 Less is More</b></p>
        <p>I was asked to scale back several interactions, such as the hover function and overlay animations.</p>
        <p>My goal had been to use animation to capture user attention and to accommodate low-vision needs.</p>
        <p>However, instead I discovered that too much movement on the screen was distracting and unpleasant for my users. For transitions, low key is generally preferable. For low-vision usability, one strong visual detail – such as reversing positive/negative colours – is sufficient.</p>
        <p>I also am learning not to be afraid of repeating a design element, interaction, or animation. In fact, these patterns help users to use a site and anticipate the results of their inputs. The repetition of events can create a calm, predictable environment that is appropriate for a government website, especially, where trust and dependability are key brand characteristics.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>#3 There is No Such Thing as Perfection</b></p>
        <p>During several of the initial phases of wireframing and testing, I invested too much time trying to arrive at a “perfect” solution alone. I researched solutions on Dribble and other design sites for similar situations, read articles on how professional designers went about solving data-heavy “mega” government sites and studies award-winning government sites for their navigation and UI strategies.</p>
        <p>While this was helpful for my learning as a student, I should have instead prototyped each idea and then put it in front of users. This agile build-and-test methodology is more efficient and situates the dilemma into concrete user interactions.</p>
        <p>In particular, I’ve grown in my understanding of wireframing as a phase for testing functionality of information structures and assumptions about user pathways and should be developed quickly and tested often.</p>
